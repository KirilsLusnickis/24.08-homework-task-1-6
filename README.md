# E-Commerce Shop

A lightweight front-end prototype for a modern e-commerce storefront. The project is structured as a static site with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so it can be deployed on any static hosting platform.

## Features

- Responsive layout with sections for hero, product catalogue, and testimonials
- Reusable product cards rendered from JavaScript data
- Client-side shopping cart preview with persistent state in `localStorage`
- Product filters for category and price range, plus keyword search
- Accessible colour palette and semantic HTML structure

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the project with any static file server.
3. Interact with the product grid, filter controls, and cart preview to explore the demo experience.

## Development

The JavaScript and styles are deliberately organised in simple directories:

- `styles/main.css` contains the core styling, component utilities, and responsive breakpoints.
- `scripts/app.js` handles product rendering, filtering, cart state, and UI interactions.

Feel free to extend the data model, integrate with an API, or port the layout to your preferred framework.
